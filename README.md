# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Greeshma Gopinath  

ðŸŽ“ Aspiring PhD researcher in **bioinformatics and neurodegeneration**  
ðŸ”¬ Researching **cell-to-cell communication in glaucoma** through **scRNA-seq & proteomics**  
ðŸŒ± Passionate about integrating **statistics, omics data, and biology** to uncover molecular mechanisms of disease

## ðŸ“˜ My Research Journey  

I began my scientific journey with a strong **statistical background** during my Masterâ€™s degree.  
Through coursework in **RStudio**, I learned methods such as:  
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)  
- Mixed linear models  
- Regression approaches  

This gave me a quantitative foundation and became a **stepping stone into bioinformatics**.  

As biology has become increasingly **data-driven and omics-focused**, I grew fascinated by the idea that understanding molecular mechanisms begins at the **cellular level**. That curiosity drove me to teach myself new computational methods and dive deeper into large-scale biological data analysis.

## ðŸ”¬ Current Research Focus  

My research centers on understanding **how retinal cells communicate and degenerate in glaucoma**.

### ðŸ§¬ What Iâ€™ve Explored
- **Single-cell RNA-seq analysis (scRNA-seq)** of the retina and anterior eye.  
- **Ligandâ€“receptor analysis** to map potential cell-to-cell communication pathways.  
- Investigating **microRNA target distribution** across retinal cell types to uncover post-transcriptional regulation in glaucoma.  
- **Proteomics-based deconvolution**:  
  - Built a **cellular reference matrix** from scRNA cell types.  
  - Applied it to **extracellular vesicle (EV) proteomics data** to estimate contributions of retinal cell populations.  
  - This approach addresses the lack of robust methods to isolate EVs by cell type.  

### ðŸŽ¯ Long-Term Goal
To map **intercellular communication networks in glaucoma**, linking **omics data** to mechanisms of **gliosis and degeneration**.
